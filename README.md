The ghouls can help you.

# Breaking Changes

## v2.0.0
- **Command names have changed:**
  - `prunePullRequests` → `remote`
  - `pruneLocalBranches` → `local`
  
  If you have scripts using the old commands, please update them to use the new shorter names.

# Getting started

## Install

`pnpm add -g ghouls`

## Authentication

Ghouls uses GitHub CLI authentication. Make sure you have the GitHub CLI (`gh`) installed and authenticated:

```bash
# Install GitHub CLI if you haven't already
# See: https://cli.github.com/

# Authenticate with GitHub CLI
gh auth login
```

That's it! Ghouls will automatically use your existing GitHub CLI authentication.

# Commands

## Delete remote branches

Safely deletes remote branches that have been merged via pull requests.

Run from within a git repository (auto-detects repo):
```bash
ghouls remote --dry-run
```

The auto-detection feature works with both github.com and GitHub Enterprise repositories, automatically detecting the repository owner/name from the remote URL.

Or specify a repository explicitly:
```bash
ghouls remote --dry-run myorg/myrepo
```

```
$ ghouls remote myorg/myrepo
#1871 - Deleting remote: heads/fix/fe-nits
#1821 - Deleting remote: heads/fix/collaborator-search
#1799 - Deleting remote: heads/fix-yarn-for-1.24
#1758 - Skipping remote: heads/ml/search-polish (mismatched refs)
...
```

## Delete local branches

Safely deletes local branches that have been merged via pull requests. This command includes comprehensive safety checks to protect important branches and work in progress.

Run from within a git repository (auto-detects repo):
```bash
ghouls local --dry-run
```

Or specify a repository explicitly:
```bash
ghouls local --dry-run myorg/myrepo
```

### Safety Features

The `local` command includes several safety checks to prevent accidental deletion of important branches:

- **Current branch protection**: Never deletes the currently checked out branch
- **Protected branch names**: Automatically protects `main`, `master`, `develop`, `dev`, `staging`, `production`, and `prod` branches
- **SHA verification**: Only deletes branches where the local SHA matches the pull request head SHA
- **Merge verification**: Only considers pull requests that were actually merged (not just closed)
- **Unpushed commits protection**: Skips branches that have unpushed commits
- **Dry-run mode**: Use `--dry-run` to see what would be deleted without making changes

### Example Output

```
$ ghouls local --dry-run

Scanning for local branches that can be safely deleted...
Found 15 local branches
Fetching merged pull requests from GitHub...
Found 42 merged pull requests

Branch Analysis:
  Safe to delete: 3
  Unsafe to delete: 12

Skipping unsafe branches:
  - main (protected branch)
  - feature/wip-work (2 unpushed commits)
  - fix/critical-bug (current branch)
  - hotfix/emergency (SHA mismatch with PR head)

Would delete 3 branches:
[DRY RUN] Would delete: feature/user-auth (#123)
[DRY RUN] Would delete: fix/typo-fix (#124)
[DRY RUN] Would delete: refactor/cleanup (#125)

Summary:
  Would delete: 3 branches
  Skipped (unsafe): 12
